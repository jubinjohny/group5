                        <p>I have worked on a multitude of web and cloud based projects for a range of clients providing Web Design (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign) and Development (PHP, HTML, CSS, JS, Angular, jQuery, WordPress, Bootstrap, Responsive Layouts), e-commerce Solutions, Graphic Designs and Cloud based solutions (AWS, GCP, Azure, Digital Ocean). During my Mobile Solutions Degree, I studied Application Development on both Android and IOS along with Web Designing and UI/UX, and therefore have a keen understanding of wireframes, sitemaps and user experience design, which I put to good use on every project I work on.<br>I am quietly confident, naturally curious, and perpetually working on improving my chops one design problem at a time. I currently live in Canada. I am always available to discuss your project over the phone or via e-mail.</p>
